OAI-PMH to Learning Registry Publish Utility
--------------------------------------------

This Python script, based on code developed by ADL in the U.S., harvests data from an OAI-PMH endpoint (Jorum, in this case), converts the data to Learning Registry resource data (JSON envelopes) and publishes the data on a Learning Registry node (the JLeRN Alpha node, in this case).


Additional Python modules required:
oaipmh 2.4.4
elementtree 1.2.6
